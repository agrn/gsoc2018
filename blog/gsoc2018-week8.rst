:summary: Some updates on my series about the reflog manipulation, and
          ``complete_action()``.

`Last week`_, I sent the first iteration of my patch series about the
reflog manipulation. Today, I sent the `fourth one`__. I had to make
some corrections on comments, commit messages, code style, etc. I will
probably send another iteration soon, because of a naming problem.

I also started to convert ``complete_action()`` last week, and I think
itâ€™s good enough for the list now. I will wait for my work on reflog
to be accepted before sending this series.

I think the next step will be to convert
``initiate_action()``. ``git-rebase--interactive.sh`` starts to be
pretty empty now.
