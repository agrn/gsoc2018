Not much happened this week, unfortunately. This was my last week of
exams at my university, so I focused on that.

But wait, I still have something!

Splitting -p from -i
--------------------

As I teased in `last week’s post`_, I started the work to move ``-p``
to a new script. At this point, I did not post any code to the mailing
list, but I sent `some preliminary changes`_ to my mentors, who gave
me very valuable feedback.

I hope I can send these changes to the list next week.
